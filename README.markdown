# Analysis of poisoned names 

This project is more completely described on [my blog post](http://hilaryparker.com/2013/01/30/hilary-the-most-poisoned-baby-name-in-us-history/). 

For access to the code for scraping the data from the social security administration baby names website, look in the `munge` and `lib` directories.

For access to the data that has been pulled from the website and formatted as (rows=names, columns=years), go to the `cache` directory.

For the code for the analysis, go to the `src` directory.

I organized the code using [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/), an R package that provides a systematic template for organizing code. ProjectTemplate also allows for easy loading of the project.

Have fun!!
